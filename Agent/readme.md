# Emwebed Agent Readme

## Summary
Emwebed Agent will run on different host machines and will be responsible for managing the hosted devices, test-kits, development boards etc. on behalf of Emwebed Server.

## Requirements
- Ensure that you've created an Agent Instance on Emwebed Server and saved the agent's configuration json on the host machine.
- The Agent when launched, will use the json configuration received from Emwebed Server, to authenticate itself. The server will allow Agent's operations only when it has valid Agent JSON configuration.

## Installation
